# commitfmt [![Quality Assurance](https://github.com/mishamyrt/commitfmt/actions/workflows/qa.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mishamyrt/commitfmt/actions/workflows/qa.yaml)

Utility for formatting and verifying the commit message.

It's not a linter. At least not a complete replacement for commitlint, because commitfmt can't prevent you from writing a body or force you to write a description in uppercase (I don't know why you might want to do that), but it will help keep the story high quality.
