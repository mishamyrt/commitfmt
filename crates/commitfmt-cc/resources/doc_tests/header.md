# Header

This file contains tests for git commit message header.
The header is the first line of the commit, which necessarily contains a description,
and can also include type and scope.

> Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short
> (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line
> and then a more thorough description.
> The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title,
> and that title is used throughout Git.
