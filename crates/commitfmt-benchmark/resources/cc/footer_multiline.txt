feat(parser): improve error handling for invalid input

Add detailed error messages and context for parsing failures.
This helps users quickly identify and fix issues in their commit messages.

BREAKING CHANGE: error messages now include line numbers and context
 to aid debugging. Update your tooling if you rely on previous formats.
