ci: run all benchmarks

Run all benchmarks in CI for comprehensive performance tracking.

Authored-By: CI Automation <ci@example.com>

# This commit updates the CI workflow to ensure that all benchmarks are executed
# on every push and pull request. The main motivation is to catch performance
# regressions early and provide more visibility into the impact of code changes.
#
# Key changes:
# - Modified .github/workflows/benchmark.yml to include all available benchmarks.
# - Ensured that benchmarks are run on both stable and nightly toolchains.
# - Added matrix strategy to test across multiple operating systems (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest).
# - Updated caching logic to improve CI speed and reliability.
# - Improved artifact upload for benchmark results, making it easier to compare runs.
# - Added step to post benchmark summary as a comment on PRs.
# - Refactored workflow steps for better readability and maintainability.
# - Increased timeout for long-running benchmarks to avoid false negatives.
# - Added environment variable support for custom benchmark configuration.
# - Improved error handling and reporting for failed benchmark runs.
#
# Additional context:
# Running all benchmarks in CI is critical for maintaining the performance
# guarantees of the project. Previously, only a subset of benchmarks was executed,
# which allowed some regressions to slip through. With this change, every code
# change will be evaluated against the full suite of performance tests.
#
# The workflow now leverages GitHub Actions' matrix builds to parallelize
# benchmark execution, reducing overall CI time. Caching improvements ensure
# that dependencies are not recompiled unnecessarily, further speeding up the
# feedback loop for contributors.
#
# The benchmark results are now uploaded as artifacts and summarized in PR
# comments, making it easier for reviewers to assess the impact of changes.
# This also helps in tracking performance trends over time.
#
# The workflow has been tested on all supported platforms and toolchains.
# Special care was taken to ensure compatibility with both stable and nightly
# Rust, as some benchmarks rely on nightly-only features.
#
# Known limitations:
# - Some benchmarks may still be flaky on Windows due to file locking issues.
# - Artifact upload may fail for very large result sets; consider splitting
#   results if this becomes a problem.
# - Benchmark summary comments require a GitHub token with write permissions.
#
# Future improvements:
# - Integrate with external performance dashboards for long-term tracking.
# - Add support for custom benchmark filters via workflow dispatch inputs.
# - Explore using self-hosted runners for more consistent performance results.
# - Investigate flaky benchmarks and improve their reliability.
# - Add notifications for significant performance regressions.
#
# This change is part of ongoing efforts to improve CI reliability and
# maintain high code quality standards. Feedback from the team is welcome.
#
# Please review the updated workflow and suggest any further improvements.

# Example benchmark output (truncated):
# running 10 tests
# test bench_add ... bench:   1,234 ns/iter (+/- 56)
# test bench_sub ... bench:   1,567 ns/iter (+/- 78)
# test bench_mul ... bench:   1,890 ns/iter (+/- 90)
# ...
