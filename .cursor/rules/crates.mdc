commitfmt is an utility for formatting and verifying the commit message. It written in Rust using nom parser.

## Crates

- commitfmt - cli entrypoint
- commitfmt_cc - conventional commits parser. Returns structs that can be converted to message string
- commitfmt_workspace - contains configuration structures, as well as functions that allow you to send the configuration in different formats
- commitfmt_git - contains wrappers over the git cli utility, as well as functions to simplify working with git
- commitfmt_format - contains formatter, that add configured footers to message.
- commitfmt_linter - package containing linting rules. The rules are divided by parts of the comit (footer, header, body). Violations of some rules can be automatically corrected. Some rules accept parameters (e.g. maximum string length)
- commitfmt_macros - contains macros that are used by other crates. Needed to separate proc_macro from other crates
