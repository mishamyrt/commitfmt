commitfmt is an utility for formatting and verifying commit messages. It written in Rust.

By design, commitfmt runs on the prepare-commit-msg hook and formats the message according to git standards and conventional commits in particular.

## Crates

- commitfmt - cli entrypoint.
- commitfmt-cc - conventional commits parser. Returns structs that can be converted to message string
- commitfmt-workspace - contains configuration structures, as well as functions that allow you to send the configuration in different formats
- commitfmt-git - contains wrappers over the git cli utility, as well as functions to simplify working with git
- commitfmt-format - contains formatter, that add footers from configuration to message.
- commitfmt-linter - package containing linting rules. The rules are divided by parts of the comit (`footer`, `header`, `body`). Violations of some rules can be automatically corrected. Some rules accept parameters (e.g. `max-length`)
- commitfmt-macros - contains macros that are used by other crates. Needed to separate proc_macro from other crates
